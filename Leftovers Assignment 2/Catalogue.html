		<p>Christian is shopping for some furniture to redecorate his room. <br>  
		He prefers to use his phone when it comes to shopping as  <br> 
		it is easier to navigate through catalogues on his phone.<br> 
		Christian tends to get confused when he shops on a webpage  <br>  
		instead of an app as webpages tend to have many functions  <br>  
		and pages. Christian stumbles upon FlippingRooms <br>  
		and realises this app come with a build in catalogue feature.   <br>  
		The catalogue feature allows him to browse through a huge variety <br>
		of furniture at ease
